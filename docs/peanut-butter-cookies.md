# Peanut Butter Cookies

## Ingredients

- [ ] 1 Cup Peanut Butter
- [ ] 1 Cup Sugar, *Cane or Coconut*
- [ ] 6 Tbs Milk
- [ ] 2 tsp Vanillia Extract
- [ ] 1 Cup Flour, *all-purpose*
- [ ] 1 tsp Baking Soda
- [ ] A pinch of Salt (only if butter is unsalted)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a cookie sheet with silicone mat, parchment paper or leave un-greased.
2. Make the dough: In a large bowl, add the peanut butter and sugar and mix until creamy. Stir in the almond milk and vanilla. Next, add the flour, baking soda and salt, mix to combine. The dough will be tough to stir, using your hands to mix it together will be easier.
3. Roll and flatten: Using a 1.5 tablespoon scooper, scoop out the dough and roll into balls, about 1 1/4 inch. Place the balls of dough about 2 1/2 inches apart on a baking sheet. Using the back of a fork, flatten in a crisscross pattern. Optionally, sprinkle with sugar or coarse salt.
4. Bake: Place in the oven and bake for 10 – 13 minutes (13 minutes will yield a crispier cookie that’s tender inside). Let cool a few minutes, transfer cookies to wire rack and repeat with remaining dough.
5. Makes 20 – 24 cookies.
