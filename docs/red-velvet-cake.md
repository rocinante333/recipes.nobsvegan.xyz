## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Spray 2 7-inch cake pans with non-stick spray and line the bottoms with parchment paper. Set aside.
2. Sift the flour into a mixing bowl.
3. Add the sugar, baking soda, salt and cocoa powder.
4. To make the vegan buttermilk, add 1 Tbsp lemon juice to a measuring jug and then add soy milk up to the 1 cup (240ml) line. Leave to sit for a minute, it will curdle into buttermilk.
5. Add the buttermilk, vanilla, oil, vinegar and red food dye into the mixing bowl and mix in.
6. Use a hand whisk briefly to get rid of any large lumps.
7. Divide the cake batter evenly between the two cake pans.
8. Place into the oven and bake for 30 minutes.
9. After 30 minutes, insert a toothpick into the center of one of the cake layers and if it comes out clean, it is cooked.
10. Transfer the cakes to a wire cooling rack and allow to cool completely before frosting.
11. While the cakes are cooling, add the powdered sugar, vegan butter, lemon juice and vanilla to an electric mixing bowl and starting at slow speed gradually increase speed until the frosting is thick and smooth.
12. It should be thick enough that it doesn't slide off the cake, but not so thick that you can't easily spread it. If the frosting is too thick, add a little more lemon juice. If it is too thin, add more powdered sugar until you reach the right consistency.
13. Spread frosting over the top of one of the cake layers. Add the other layer on top and frost the top and sides.
14. Add cherries to decorate.
