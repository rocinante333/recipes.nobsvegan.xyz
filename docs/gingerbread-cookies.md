## Ingredients

=== "Cookies"
    - [ ] 1 Cup Brown Sugar, packed
    - [ ] 1/3 Cup Butter, softened
    - [ ] 1 1/2 Cup Molasses
    - [ ] 2/3 Cup Filtered Water
    - [ ] 2 tsp Baking Soda
    - [ ] 3 tsp Ground Ginger
    - [ ] 1 tsp Pink Salt
    - [ ] 1 tsp Ground AllSpice
    - [ ] 1 tsp Ground Cloves
    - [ ] 1 tsp Ground Cinnamon
    - [ ] 7 Cups Flour, all-purpose
=== "Royal Icing"
    - [ ] 3 Cups Powdered Sugar
    - [ ] 2 tsp Lemon Juice
    - [ ] 2 Tbs Filtered Water

## Instructions

1. In a stand mixer using the paddle attachment (or in a large bowl with electric beaters if doing by hand), cream together brown sugar and vegan butter on low speed. Slowly stir in molasses, followed by water, keeping the mixer running. Next, add in the baking soda and all the spices. Lastly, pour in the flour and beat until combined well. Dough should be stiff, NOT runny.
2. Remove dough and shape into a ball. Wrap with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. When I make gingerbread, I like to make it the night before and keep it refrigerated overnight. If you leave it in the fridge overnight, place on the counter to soften for about 15 minutes before you try to roll it out.
3. Once you are ready to roll, preheat oven to 350Â°. Remove plastic wrap. On a floured surface, roll dough 1/4 inch thick. Personally, I like to split my dough ball into a few pieces (giving each one to one of my kids to roll out), instead of trying to roll one big piece of dough. Cut out gingerbread people using a shaped cutter, then place them about 2 inches apart on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for about 9-10 minutes for a crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside cookie. For REALLY crunchy cookies, cook for 11 minutes.
4. Allow cookies to cool on rack before frosting. To frost, first mix royal icing ingredients in a stand mixer (or a medium mixing bowl with electric beaters) and transfer to a piping bag.
