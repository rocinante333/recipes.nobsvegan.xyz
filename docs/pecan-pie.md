## Ingredients

| **Item**                | **Amount** |
| ----------------------- | ---------- |
| Pie Crust               | N/A        |
| Pecans, roughly chopped | 2 Cups     |
| Butter                  | 1/4 Cup    |
| Cane Sugar              | 1 Cup      |
| Maple Syrup             | 1/2 Cup    |
| Coconut Milk, full fat  | 3/4 Cup    |
| Cornstarch              | 1/3 Cup    |
| Ground Golden Flaxseeds | 1 Tbs      |
| Vanilla Extract         | 1 tsp      |
| Ground Cinnamon         | 1/2 tsp    |
| Himalayan Pink Salt     | 1/2 tsp    |

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 350Â° F. 
2. Sift cornstarch and flaxseed into creamer or milk, then whisk together in a bowl.
3. Meanwhile, melt butter in a medium-sized pot on medium heat. 
4. Add sugar, maple syrup, and creamer mixture. Whisk until thoroughly combined, then add pecans, vanilla, cinnamon, and salt. 
5. Remove the pot from the stove and pour the filling into the crust. Bake the pie for 45-55 minutes, until mostly solid. It is alright if the middle still shakes since it will harden as it cools
