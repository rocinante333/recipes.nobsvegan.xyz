## Ingredients

- [ ] Pie Crust
- [ ] 2 Cups Pecans, roughly chopped
- [ ] 1/4 Cup Butter
- [ ] 1 Cup Cane Sugar
- [ ] 1/2 Cup Maple Syrup
- [ ] 3/4 Cup Coconut Milk, full fat
- [ ] 1/3 Cup Cornstarch
- [ ] 1 Tbs Ground Golden Flaxseeds
- [ ] 1 tsp Vanilla Extract
- [ ] 1/2 tsp Ground Cinnamon
- [ ] 1/2 tsp Himalayan Pink Salt

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350Â° F. 
2. Sift cornstarch and flaxseed into creamer or milk, then whisk together in a bowl.
3. Meanwhile, melt butter in a medium-sized pot on medium heat. 
4. Add sugar, maple syrup, and creamer mixture. Whisk until thoroughly combined, then add pecans, vanilla, cinnamon, and salt. 
5. Remove the pot from the stove and pour the filling into the crust. Bake the pie for 45-55 minutes, until mostly solid. It is alright if the middle still shakes since it will harden as it cools
