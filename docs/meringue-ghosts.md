# Meringue Ghosts 2

## Ingredients

- [ ] 1 Can Chickpeas (Aquafaba)
- [ ] Powdered Sugar, Ratio of 2 part sugar to 1 part aquafaba
- [ ] 1/4 tsp Cream of Tartar
- [ ] 1 tsp Almond Extract (or vanilla)
- [ ] Chocolate for decorating

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 200Â°F. Line baking trays with parchment paper.
2. Put the aquafaba, cream of tartar, and almond extract in the bowl of your stand mixer or use a hand mixer.
3. Start whisking on low speed, increasing to maximum once the meringue starts to double in volume. Continue whisking until it forms soft peaks.
4. Add the sugar, a tablespoon at a time, while continuing to whisk at high speed.
5. Once all the sugar has been added, continue to whisk until the meringue is glossy and forms firm peaks. This can take up to 10 minutes. At this moment, the sugar has been completely incorporated, you shouldn't see any sugar grains anymore.
6. Spoon the meringue into a large piping bag fitted with a plain round tip.
7. Pipe ghost shapes on the trays.
8. Bake for 1 hour, without opening the oven door. The meringues are baked when dry and lift easily off the paper.
9. Turn the oven off, leave the door partly open and let the meringues cool completely.
