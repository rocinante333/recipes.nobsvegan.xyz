!!! info "Notes"
    1. Mahleb powder is used to flavor the maamoul. It is a tradition to use it, but you can use crushed mastic, cinnamon or skip it.
    2. You can use ghee, butter, oil or a combination.
    3. Simple syrup is made by boiling 1 cup sugar + 1 cup water and 1/2 teaspoon of lime/lemon juice, then reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Add vanilla, rose water, orange blossom water for flavor if desired. Let it cool completely before using in maamoul.
    4. For pistachio and walnut filling some people like to finely process 3/4 of the nuts leaving the rest roughly chopped for a chunkier filling. You can make the whole batch with any of the fillings above by tripling the amount of the desired filling.
