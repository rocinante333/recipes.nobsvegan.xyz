## Instructions

=== "Chocolate Dough"
    1. Lightly grease an 8-inch spring-form pan and line the bottom with parchment paper. Then, place in the fridge for 5-10 minutes while you make the dough. (It's easier to press the dough into a chilled pan).
    2. Combine the flour, baking powder, salt, cocoa and sugar in a mixing bowl. Cut the cold vegan butter into small pieces, then add to the flour mixture and knead everything with your hands (or use a food processor) until a dough forms. Add the non-dairy milk as needed.
    3. Reserve about 1/3 of the dough for the spots on top. Roll out the remaining dough as shown in the step-by-step photos above and place it in the spring-form pan. (If the dough is very sticky, you can wrap it in cling foil and refrigerate for 1 hour, so the butter solidifies and the dough gets firmer).
=== "Cheesecake Filling"
    1. Preheat the oven to 356°F (180°C).
    2. Slowly melt the vegan butter in a small saucepan (but don‘t boil it ).
    3. In a cup, stir the cornstarch into the non-dairy milk to dissolve.
    4. Place the soy quark (drained yogurt*), coconut milk, sugar and vanilla extract in a large mixing bowl and mix with a hand mixer until smooth and creamy. Then mix in the melted vegan butter, lemon juice, and the cornstarch mixture.
    5. Spread the cheesecake filling on the chocolate crust and smooth it out evenly. Place the cake in the pre-heated oven and bake for about 30 minutes.
    6. Form the reserved 1/3 chocolate dough into cow-spots (or streusel) and place them on top of the pre-baked cheesecake. Put the cake back in the oven and bake for another 30 minutes. Let cool to room temperature, then place in the fridge overnight to set completely.
    7. Dust your Russian cheesecake with powdered sugar and garnish with fresh raspberries if desired. Cut into pieces and enjoy!
