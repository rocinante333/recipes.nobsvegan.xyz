## Instructions
 
1. Make the Cake: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease two 8â€”inch cake pans and line the bottom with parchment paper, then grease tops of paper. Set aside. 
2. In a small bowl, or a liquid measuring pourer, combine the almond milk and the apple cider vinegar (it will look like it separates and this is totally ok). Set aside for at least 5 minutes.
3. In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, spices and salt. Set aside.
4. In a large bowl, or the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat together the sugar, oil and chai tea until combined. Add the vanilla and almond extracts and beat on low for 5 seconds to combine.
5. Alternate adding the flour and the almond milk mixtures to the batter, starting and ending with the flour, mixing until smooth and just combined. Divide the batter between the two cake pans. Bake for 30-35 minutes (about 20-25 minutes if you're making 4 smaller layers). Let sit in the pan for at least 10 minutes before carefully flipping onto a cooling rack to cool completely. Wrap each layer in plastic wrap and refrigerate until you're ready to frost.
6. Make the Frosting: In a large bowl with a hand mixer, or in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the coconut oil and powdered sugar until smooth and light, It will likely be a little stiff. Add in the vanilla, coconut extract and shredded coconut and beat until combined. Gradually add the almond milk, a tablespoon at a time, until you've reached a creamy, light and spreadable consistency.
7. Frost the Cake: Place one cake layer on a piece of parchment paper or on a serving plate. Spread about a third of the frosting on the top of the cake, then top with the other cake half. With an offset spatula or knife, cover the cake with a thin layer of frosting to smooth out the edges and the space between the layers (this is also known as the "crumb coat"). Place the cake in the fridge for about 10 minutes until the frosting firms up slightly. Remove and coat entire cake with another layer of frosting, You can also pip, die frosting on in a decorative fashion at this stage. Keep completed cake refrigerated if possible, removing 2-3 hours before serving.
