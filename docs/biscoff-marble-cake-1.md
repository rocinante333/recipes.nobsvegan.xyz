## Instructions

=== "Preperation"
    1. Pre-heat oven to 350F.
    2. Grease and flour 2 8” cake pans, or spray with oil spray and line with parchment paper.
    3. In a large bowl, mix all-purpose flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt.
    4. In another bowl mix the almond milk, avocado oil, lemon juice, and vanilla extract together.
    5. Add dry ingredients to wet. Whisk gently until smooth.
    6. Separate the batter into 2 different bowls. You can divide the batter evenly between the two bowls. Then remove about 1/2 cup of batter from one bowl and put on the other bowl.
    7. The bowl with more batter will be the vanilla plain cake batter.
    8. To the bowl with less batter, add the Biscoff butter, and the almond milk.
    9. Whisk until incorporated.
=== "To Bake"
    1. Pour about 1/3 cup of batter of vanilla cake batter on the bottom of a cake pan, right in the middle. On top, put about 1/4 cup of the Biscoff cake batter, again in the center of the pan. Repeat this until you used up half of each batter.
    2. Move on to the other cake pan and do the same. Start with a vanilla layer, and then put Biscoff batter on top. Repeat until all batter is gone.
    3. Refer to the post above to see pictures on how to do this.
    4. Bake cakes for about 20-25 min, rotating cakes around in the oven in between, to ensure even baking.
    5. Cakes will be done when you can gently touch the top of the cake, and it will spring back. Or use a toothpick to poke the cake, and if it comes clean without any wet batter, your cakes are done baking. Another sign to tell when your cake is done baking, is that the cake will be coming off from the sides of the pan.
    6. Remove cakes from the oven. Let them cool for 10 minutes and flip them onto a cooling rack. Let them cool all the way before frosting, and even better, let them sit in the fridge for a couple of hours and up to a day before you frost. This is a fluffy cake, so might be easier to frost if it’s cold from the fridge. But remember to wrap it in plastic wrap if you choose to store it in the fridge for a while, so it does not get dry.
=== "To Make"
    1. Place vegan butter, shortening, and cookie butter in a bowl of an electric mixer.
    2. Cream on medium high speed for 1 minute.
    3. With the mixer off, add sifted powdered sugar.
    4. Mix on low until combined.
    5. Raise speed to medium high and cream for 1 or two minutes until creamy. Add vanilla. Add milk if necessary to adjust consistency. If frosting seems too stiff, add a little bit of milk at a time. If frosting seems too runny, add a bit more sifted powdered sugar until you achieve the desired consistency, which should be smooth.
=== "To Assemble"
    1. Place one layer of cake on a cake plate.
    2. Pipe a ring of Biscoff frosting around the edges of the cake.
    3. Spread about 1/4-1/3 cup of Biscoff cookie butter in the middle.
    4. Place the other cake layer on top.
    5. Cover with the frosting, using an offset spatula or scraper to smooth the edges.
    6. Use your hands to attach some cookie crumbs to the sides of the cake.
    7. Pipe swirls on top of the cake and Biscoff cookies on top, if you want to.
